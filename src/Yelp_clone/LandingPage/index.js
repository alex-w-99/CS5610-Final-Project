                <span>CONTAINS: search feature / login option / our page icon and logo -- maybe we create one</span>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Container option main div holds the rows and utilize components to supplement the nav bar feature</p>
                <p>This is where the container for the card- bootstrap ref - comes in</p>
                <span>containing an image potentially scrolling and text underneath welcoming to the site</span>

            <div>

                    footnote - small container holding a similar functionality to the nav bar
                    - ideal concept is that it holds a small contact page where we can have a messaging service
                    - a meet the devs page where we can all have our small info for jobs etc.
                    - any ideas here ...
